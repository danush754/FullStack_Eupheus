    <h2 id="headingthree">Steps</h2>
    <ol id="secondlist">
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°. Score zucchini (like you're dicing an avocado) and scoop out insides with a small spoon, leaving a ¼”-thick border intact. Chop zucchini pulp and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place zucchini boats in a large baking dish and drizzle all over with oil. Season with salt and pepper and sprinkle thyme on top. Bake until tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add shrimp and season with salt and pepper. Cook until pink and cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat, let cool, then chop into bite-size pieces. </li>
        <li>Return skillet to medium heat and melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Add reserved zucchini pulp, tomatoes, and garlic, season with salt and pepper, and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more. Add cream, Parmesan, and lemon juice, and cook until slightly reduced, 3 minutes. Remove from heat and fold in cooked shrimp.</li>
        <li>Fill zucchini boats with shrimp mixture and top with mozzarella. Bake until cheese is bubbly, about 10 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Garnish with more Parmesan and parsley, before serving.</li>
